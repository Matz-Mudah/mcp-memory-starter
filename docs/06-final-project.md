# Finishing Your Project

You've built something cool! Let's make sure it's complete and works well.

## Core Requirements Checklist

### ‚úÖ Functionality

- [ ] **Store memory tool works**
  - Accepts text input
  - Generates embeddings
  - Saves to database

- [ ] **Search memory tool works**
  - Finds memories by meaning (semantic search)
  - Returns similarity scores
  - Shows relevant results

- [ ] **Persistence**
  - Database file created
  - Memories survive server restart

- [ ] **MCP Integration**
  - Connects to at least one AI platform
  - Tools appear and work correctly

### üìù Code Quality

- [ ] Code builds without errors
- [ ] Functions handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Variable names are clear
- [ ] Comments explain complex logic

### üìö Documentation

**Your README.md should include:**
- [ ] Project description (what it does)
- [ ] Setup instructions (step-by-step)
- [ ] How to use it (example commands)
- [ ] Dependencies and requirements

## Testing Your Project

### Test 1: Fresh Install
1. Clone your repo to a new folder
2. Follow YOUR setup instructions exactly
3. Does it work?

If not, fix your README!

### Test 2: Semantic Search
Store these memories:
```
"I love pizza"
"TypeScript is awesome"
"The weather is sunny"
```

Search: "What food do I like?"
- ‚úÖ Should find "pizza"
- ‚ùå Should NOT find TypeScript or weather

If search isn't working semantically, check your cosine similarity calculation.

### Test 3: Persistence
1. Store memories
2. Stop server
3. Restart server
4. Search again

Memories should still be there!

## Making It Yours

### Creative Use Cases

Make your project unique with a specific theme:

**Ideas:**
- Recipe memory (search by ingredients)
- Study notes (search by topic/concept)
- Code snippets library
- Movie/book tracker
- Gaming achievements log
- Workout tracker

### Optional Extensions

Want to go further? Try these:

**Intermediate:**
- Add metadata filtering
- Delete memory tool
- List all memories
- Export/import data

**Advanced:**
- Multiple collections
- Metadata search
- Qdrant integration (see [Advanced Guide](07-advanced-production.md))

---

## Common Issues & Fixes

### "My search returns wrong results"
- Check cosine similarity is calculated correctly
- Verify embeddings are being generated
- Test with simple, distinct memories first

### "Database doesn't persist"
- Check `DB_PATH` in `.env`
- Verify `initDatabase()` is called on startup
- Make sure you're not creating a new DB each time

### "MCP tools don't appear"
- Rebuild: `npm run build`
- Check tool definitions are exported
- Verify MCP config points to your server

## Submission Tips

**Before you submit:**
1. Test on a fresh clone
2. Check README instructions are clear
3. Remove personal paths/info
4. Make sure `.env.example` exists (not `.env`!)
5. Verify all core features work

**Good to have:**
- Clear commit messages
- Clean code formatting
- No leftover TODO comments
- Working example queries in README

---

## Need Help?

- **Compare with working example:** [basic-typescript-example](../examples/basic-typescript-example/)
- **Check troubleshooting:** Each setup guide has a troubleshooting section
- **Ask your teacher:** That's what they're there for!

**You've built an AI memory system from scratch - that's awesome!** üöÄ

Whether you're submitting for a grade or just learning, you now understand embeddings, semantic search, and MCP - skills used by real AI companies!
