# Examples Directory

This directory contains **complete, working implementations** of AI memory systems that students can reference.

## Available Examples

### [basic-typescript-example](basic-typescript-example/)

A fully working MCP memory system in TypeScript featuring:
- âœ… Complete database implementation (SQLite)
- âœ… Embedding generation via LM Studio
- âœ… Semantic search with cosine similarity
- âœ… Two MCP tools (store_memory, search_memory)
- âœ… Full error handling and validation
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation

**Use this example to:**
1. See what a finished product looks like
2. Test the memory system yourself
3. Understand how all the pieces fit together
4. Reference when you get stuck on your own implementation

## How to Use These Examples

### Option 1: Run and Test
```bash
cd basic-typescript-example
npm install
npm run build
npm run inspect  # Open MCP Inspector to test
```

### Option 2: Study the Code
- Read through [basic-typescript-example/src](basic-typescript-example/src/) to see implementations
- Compare with the [starter template](../starter-templates/typescript-template/)
- Understand the differences between TODOs and working code

### Option 3: Use as Reference
When working on your own project:
1. Try to implement it yourself first
2. If you get stuck, check the example
3. Understand WHY it works, don't just copy
4. Adapt the concepts to your own style

## What's Different from Templates?

| Template | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Has TODO comments | Has working code |
| Throws "not implemented" errors | Fully functional |
| Learning scaffold | Reference implementation |
| Your starting point | Your target/guide |

## Learning Path

1. **Start** â†’ Look at this working example
2. **Understand** â†’ Read the concepts docs
3. **Build** â†’ Use the template with TODOs
4. **Reference** â†’ Come back here when stuck
5. **Succeed** â†’ Build your own unique implementation!

**Remember:** The goal isn't to copy this code, but to understand it well enough to build your own version! ðŸš€
