# MCP Memory Starter Kit 🧠

**Build Your Own AI Memory System**

A student-friendly tutorial for creating AI memory systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Learn how to build tools that give AI assistants the ability to remember and recall information across conversations.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have created a working AI memory system that:
- Stores information semantically (understands meaning, not just keywords)
- Searches memories using natural language
- Integrates with AI applications (LM Studio, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible client) through MCP
- Uses local AI models (no API costs!)

## 🎓 Who This Is For

- **High school students** learning programming (VG1-VG2)
- **Apprentice developers** wanting practical AI experience
- **Anyone curious** about how AI memory systems work

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming knowledge (variables, functions, APIs)
- Willingness to learn new concepts
- A computer that can run local AI models

## 🚀 Choose Your Language

Pick the language you're most comfortable with - they all teach the same core concepts:

| Language | What's Included |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Python** | Starter template with TODOs |
| **TypeScript** | Starter template + working example |

## 📊 Project Levels

All students build the same **core project** (SQLite, embeddings, semantic search). Then you can add optional extensions:

| Level | Core Features | Optional Extensions |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Core Project** | • SQLite storage<br>• Embeddings (local)<br>• Semantic search<br>• MCP integration | Everyone completes this |
| **Intermediate** | Same core + | • Metadata filtering<br>• Multiple collections<br>• Delete/list tools |
| **Advanced** | Same core + | • Qdrant vector database<br>• Neo4j graph relationships<br>• Docker deployment<br>• Production patterns |

See [Advanced Production Guide](docs/07-advanced-production.md) for Qdrant/Neo4j/Docker setup.

## 🎯 Assignment Brief

**Official assignment for students:** See [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md)

**For teachers:** The docs are self-guided. Students can work through them at their own pace. Adjust assessment and delivery format to your needs!

## 💡 Why This Matters

Every company is adding AI features. Understanding how to build memory systems teaches you:
- **AI Integration** - How to work with embeddings and vector search
- **API Design** - Creating tools that AI assistants can use
- **Database Skills** - Working with specialized storage (vector databases)
- **Real-World Skills** - Technologies used in production AI applications
