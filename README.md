# MCP Memory Starter Kit 🧠

**Build Your Own AI Memory System**

A student-friendly tutorial for creating AI memory systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Learn how to build tools that give AI assistants the ability to remember and recall information across conversations.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

By the end of this project, you'll have created a working AI memory system that:
- Stores information semantically (understands meaning, not just keywords)
- Searches memories using natural language
- Integrates with AI applications (LM Studio, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible client) through MCP
- Uses local AI models (no API costs!)

## 🎓 Who This Is For

- **High school students** learning programming (VG1-VG2)
- **Apprentice developers** wanting practical AI experience
- **Anyone curious** about how AI memory systems work

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming knowledge (variables, functions, APIs)
- Willingness to learn new concepts
- A computer that can run local AI models

## 🚀 Choose Your Path

This tutorial supports multiple programming languages and complexity levels:

| Level | Language | What You'll Learn |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 🟢 **Beginner** | Python | Basic embeddings, simple storage, MCP tools |
| 🟡 **Intermediate** | TypeScript | Vector databases, metadata filtering, async operations |
| 🔴 **Advanced** | Go | Dual-database architecture, graph relationships, production patterns |
